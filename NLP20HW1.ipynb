    "The code in the method generator.py from Sameer Sing corresponds to the mathematical explanation provided in the blog by that it calculates the probability of the word, then divides it by the temperature, then calculates the sum of log2 of (2 ^ the quotient + 2 ^ the previous quotient), then for each result again calculates the sum of log2 of (2 ^ each result + 2 ^ the previous result), then raises 2 by the power of the differences between the two sums and if it greater then the random number then the word is being chosen. So the temperature increases each probability and then affects the next word that will be chosen."

    "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks by Andrej Karpathy Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the article we can observe that RNN language models are able to generate different texts using an input related to a certain field. For example, receiving different inputs of code samples, it can create code blocks that probably won’t compile, but will be perfectly indented and will have balanced brackets, meaning it supplies a very good frame to a code and in addition a code that is very close to a code that works. The thing that is most surprising in the experimental results reported in the blog is that while the common belief at the time the results were published was that RNNs were difficult to train, it is in fact pretty easy and powerful. We witness that by the results of the experiments shown in the article, such as the code block we discussed earlier, a Wikipedia text that the model generated pretty close to the origin, Shakespeare monologues that even though we can see it’s not a Shakespeare’s real text, the model still created pretty good monologues in an eloquent English. Another interesting result is of creating a Latex sampled algebraic geometry. It teaches us that the model is quite good at learning complicated syntactic structures. In conclusion, RNNs are good models to use for training.\n",

    "The unreasonable effectiveness of Characters-level Language Model By Yoav Goldberg Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "This article discusses the power of language models that do not use smoothing (unlike RNNs models that do use smoothing). The main claim of the writer is that unsmoothed maximum likelihood characters level language models have effectiveness on generating convincing natural language outputs. The unsmoothed maximum likelihood characters level language model works as follows. It calculates the probability of each character to appear next to a history of n characters according to the total number of times the history characters appear in the text in the same order. The article presents a few examples to how the using of that kind of model generates different English texts like a text based on Shakespeare’s sample. It shows that as greater the n as better the text the model generates. The writer is mostly impressive by the context awareness of the model. He says that the model succeeded in learning the context by the history given, for example learned well how to create nested brackets and indented blocks within a code. Finally, the writer tries the model on Linux-kernel code. On these results, he is not very satisfied by the results of the maximum likelihood characters level language models and thus concludes that LSTM, one of RNNs that uses smoothed language models, is doing its job well on texts like this, and thus summarizes that he is impressed by RNNs after all.\n",

Finally, in order to see how well the network performs on different categories, we will create a confusion matrix, indicating for every actual language (rows) which language the network guesses (columns).\n"
